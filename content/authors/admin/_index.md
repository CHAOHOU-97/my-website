I am an MD student of Medical Bioinformatics at Peking University. My doctoral works study phase separation and protein degradation (PI: [Tingting Li](http://bioinfolilab.phasep.pro/)). My research interests include<br> (1) Transcription regulation and genome organization,<br> (2) Precision medicine based on multi-omics data and single-cell data,<br> (3) Understanding protein function and regulation via deep learning,<br> (4) Drug designation and effect prediction via deep learning.<br> I was born in Zhucheng city, Shandon, China. I like basketball, skiing and photography. (update: 2023-04-16)
